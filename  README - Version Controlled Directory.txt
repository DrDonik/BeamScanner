This directory is under subversion control. In order to get a working copy for yourself, change to your local directory where you want to store the working copy and checkout the repository using

$ svn checkout svn://iapbp111.unibe.ch/LabView/BeamScanner/trunk

Once checked out, to later update your local working copy to the latest revision, use

$ svn update

Apply your changes in your working copy and commit them back to the repository using

$ svn commit -m "Description of changes"

You will need your standard IAP username and password to do so.
