### What is this repository for? ###

This software is a LabVIEW control program for a custom built two-photon excited fluorescence microscope. It controls the scanners, the stage and records the intensity, all through a NIDAQ device.

### How do I get set up? ###

The software is written in LabVIEW (2017, 64bit). You also need NIDAQ to control the I/O board and THORLABS kinesis to control the THORLABS stages.
Additionally, you need the circular buffer extension for LabVIEW. Then, open and run â€¦

### Contribution guidelines ###

This software is in productive use. When coding, make sure you don't brake the existing code (or, even better, fix the wreck), and commit.

### Who do I talk to? ###
